# Steamodded - A Balatro ModLoader

## Introduction

Steamodded is a mod loader and injector for the game Balatro. Much like the [LÃ–VE2D engine](https://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page) itself, it is built using [Lua](https://www.lua.org/). It is made with modularity and extensibility in mind, providing a large selection of APIs and other features to facilitate bringing your ideas to life.

## Installation

### How to Install Steamodded

Please refer to the [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded/wiki/01.-Getting-started) in the Steamodded guide. While it is possible to use the injector for versions 0.9.8 and below, this method is no longer recommended and is deprecated starting in version 1.0, which is current in Alpha.

### How to install the Alpha

To use the 1.0.0 pre-release version, install Steamodded [using Git](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded/wiki/01.-Getting-started#using-the-command-line-requires-git) and check out the main branch. Alternatively, [download](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the source code directly instead of the release and proceed with steps 3-6 of the manual [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded/wiki/01.-Getting-started)

## How to Install a Mod

- Navigate to your Mods directory as it was specified in the installation instructions.
- Put the mod into the directory (only the Mod File if there is only one file provided or all the files in a subdirectory)
- Launch the game and enjoy!

## Features
