# (WIP)Dimserene's Modpack (for Steamodded-1.0.0 Balatro)

#### Thank you all the mod authors, `@humplydinkle`, `@chromapie` & `@asgrich` on discord for helping and testing!
(Updates frequently)
A custom-made modpack that is hand-picked and put together by myself

Some mod files needs to be altered to avoid compat issues if you want to put the mods together, and I will specify them in the list.ï¼ˆNote that i have applied all the below-mentioned modifications in the modpack repo)

I repeat, this is not a full list of 1.0.0 compatible mods, this is a modpack that when put together and my goal is they should function with no problem.

(at least i hope, and if you wanna join us dealing with this nightmare beast, you can join our [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1255696773599592458))
