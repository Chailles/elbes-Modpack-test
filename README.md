# Balatro-Steammodded-1.0.0-Nightmare-pack (WIP)
A custom-made modpack that is hand-picked and put together by myself

Due to license reasons, I can only list the mods, and you can put them together by yourself.

Some mod files need to be altered to avoid compat issues, I will specify them in the list.
