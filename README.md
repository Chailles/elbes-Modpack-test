# Balatro-Steammodded-1.0.0-Nightmare-pack
A custom-made modpack that is hand-picked and put together by myself

Due to license reasons, I can only list the mods, and you can put them together by yourself.

Some mod files need to be altered or you'll need an older build altogether to avoid compat issues, I will specify them in the list.
