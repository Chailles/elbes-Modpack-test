# Dimserene's Modpack (for Steamodded-1.0.0 Alpha)

#### Thank you all the mod authors, `@humplydinkle`, `@chromapie`, `@asgrich` and many others on discord for helping and testing!
(Updates frequently)
A custom-made modpack that is hand-picked and put together by myself

Some mod files needs to be altered to avoid compat issues if you want to put the mods together, and I will specify them in the list.ï¼ˆNote that i have applied all the below-mentioned modifications in the modpack repo)

I repeat, this is not a full list of 1.0.0 compatible mods, this is a modpack that when put together and my goal is they should function with no problem.(at least i hope)
